# 🚧 Road Accident Analysis Dashboard  
### *(Built with Microsoft Excel – Data-Driven Insights into India’s Road Safety)*

---

## 📌 Project Objective  
This project aimed to develop a visually engaging and interactive Excel dashboard for analyzing **state-wise and category-wise road accidents** across India. The goal was to uncover **accident patterns**, identify **high-risk factors**, and provide **data-driven insights** to inform policymaking and public safety strategies.

---

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset contains detailed road accident statistics across Indian states and UTs, including:

- Number of total accidents and fatalities  
- Classification by **vehicle type** (2-wheeler, 4-wheeler, trucks, buses, etc.)  
- Temporal distribution by **time of day** and **day of week**  
- Year-wise trends

## 🛠 Tools & Techniques Used  
- **Microsoft Excel**: Pivot Tables, Charts, Slicers, Conditional Formatting  
- **Data Preparation**: Data Cleaning, Null Handling, Standardization  
- **Analysis Skills**: Risk Pattern Detection, Categorization, Temporal Analysis  
- **Visualization Skills**: User-friendly dashboard design with dynamic slicers

---

## 🔍 Project Workflow  

### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
- Removed duplicates and corrected inconsistent state/vehicle labels  
- Transformed raw tabular data into structured Excel tables  
- Created calculated fields for percentage share and risk levels  

### 2️⃣ Dashboard Design  
- Built **pivot charts** for state-wise, vehicle-wise, and time-wise trends  
- Added **slicers** for filtering by state, year, vehicle type, and accident severity  
- Applied **color-coded conditional formatting** to highlight hotspots

### 3️⃣ Insight Extraction  
- Identified most affected states and timeframes  
- Analyzed fatality rates vs total accidents  
- Compared trends across different vehicle categories

---

## 🧠 Key Insights  

- **Two-Wheelers** contribute to the highest accident share, highlighting urgent safety intervention needs.  
- **Evening and night hours** report the most accidents, implying visibility and traffic control issues.  
- **High-risk states** include Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, and Maharashtra with consistently high numbers.  
- **Weekends** observe a surge in accident frequency, suggesting need for stricter enforcement during leisure travel times.  
- Fatality rates are **not always proportional** to total accident count, indicating varied impact severity.

---

## ✅ Conclusion & Recommendations  
This dashboard enables stakeholders to **pinpoint critical accident zones**, evaluate **vehicle safety vulnerabilities**, and allocate resources effectively.  
Recommendations include:

- Implementing **state-wise road safety audits**  
- Enhancing **two-wheeler rider education and helmet enforcement**  
- Improving **road lighting** and **signage visibility** in high-frequency evening zones  
- Launching **targeted awareness campaigns** during weekends

---

## 🚀 Outcome  
The dashboard provides a **scalable analytical template** helps to predict and mitigate road accidents.
